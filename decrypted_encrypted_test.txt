Data science is a phrase that is used too often. It has no clear definition because it has been defined differently by so many different people and organizations. Moreover, simply labeling something a science doesn’t make it so.

With the phrase “data science” being applied to so many different kinds of pursuits, isn’t there a danger that the burgeoning field could become more pseudo-science rather than real science? Those of us who practice the discipline seriously and professionally have a responsibility to ensure that data science is more than nominally scientific.
